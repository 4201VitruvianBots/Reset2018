Our code uses extensive use of a USB storage device attached to the roboRIO to read/write files.
We use read/writes to files extensively both for logging and for storing configurations for the
robot. By storing configurations on the robot and having the robot read those values whenever it
initializes (In robotInit, autonomousInit, and teleopInit), we are able to reduce the amount of
code redeploys and roboRIO reboots when developing code. This has proven to be extremely useful at
events where time on the practice field is precious. By doing so, we can maximize the amount of
trials we run on our autonomous modes, which lets us tune them faster and allows us to develop
more autonomous modes at competitions.

Our file structure on the USB is as follows

4201Robot/
|-> Pathfinder/
|-> Configs/
|-> Logs/

Pathfinder: Contains .csv files generated from pathfinder for our autonomous modes.
Configs: Contains .ini files that store default configuration values for the robot.
Logs: Contains .csv log files that record values on the robot as it runs. Logs are organized into
    subfolders for easy navigation to specific files/times.
